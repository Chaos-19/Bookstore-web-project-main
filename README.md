Welcome to my final project for the Web Computer Science course! This project is a web-based book store application built with PHP for the backend and interacts with HTML using APIs. It includes several features such as an add to cart feature, authentication, search functionality, and more.

## Project Overview

This project serves as a practical demonstration of the skills and knowledge gained during the Web Computer Science course. It showcases the following key features:

- **Add to Cart Feature:** Users can add books to their shopping cart and proceed to checkout.

- **Authentication:** Secure user authentication ensures that only authorized users can access certain features or make purchases.

- **Search Functionality:** Users can search for books based on keywords, authors, or genres.

- **Responsive Design:** The web application is designed to be responsive, providing a seamless experience on various devices.
